# Experis Academy Fullstack Java and Javascript

These are my solutions for the course in Fullstack Java. 

## Katas

Katas are basically small programming exercises or challanges. These aren't graded but serves a good purpose to exercise programming. I personally find these very fun and exciting. As we discuss each others solutions after we are done. We usually have about one or one and a half hour to solve a kata before we discuss the solutions. 
I have done most of the katas with Studio Visual Code and with the terminal. Why I decided to do that is because I think it is easier to work with a text editor and usually faster when making smaller applications.

## Tasks

Tasks is the assignments we get graded on. These are usually bigger than the katas and require a bit more thinking and a cleaner solution.
The complexity of the tasks varies a lot, it could be to just show how to compile or execute in different enviroments, or to make a web application.
